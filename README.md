# Time Scheduler

## Description: Time Scheduler Application
I created a train time schedule application that provided up to date departure and arrival schedule for traveler using highspeed trains. The application was created using jQuery, Moment.JS (manipulate information to build arrival and departure time), and Firebase (database storage, which is key to the application. 
The application work in the following manner:
•	When a train is scheduled, the following information is submitted:
•	Train name
•	Destination
•	Frist Train Time.  This must be entered in military time
•	Frequency - Entered in minutes.
•	Once this information is gathered, it will calculate the next trains arrivals and make sure it is relative to the current time.
